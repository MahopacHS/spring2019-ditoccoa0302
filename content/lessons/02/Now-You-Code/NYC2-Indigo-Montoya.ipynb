One of the many notable scenes involves a character Indigo Montoya who explains his character's motivation for revenge through the catch-phase:\n\n\"Hello. My name is Indigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\"\n\nYou can watch the clip here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY4cnMmo9qw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY4cnMmo9qw)\n\nWrite a program in Python which asks the user to enter **your name**, a **relative** and an **past-tense action**. For example if you enter \"Indigo Montoya\", \"Father\" and \"killed\", the program will then output:\n\n\"Hello. My name is Indigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\"\n\nOr you could input \"Mike Fudge\", \"Uncle\" and \"Tickled\" to get:\n\n\"Hello. My name is Mike Fudge. You Tickled my Uncle. Prepare to die!\"\n"

Why?\n\nThe code still executes because it can't tell the difference between a name and a past tense action. It just stores the string of letters to use it later.\n\n2. What type of error it when the program runs but does not handle bad input?\n\nA logical error\n\n3. Is there anything you can do in code to correct this type of error? Why or why not?\n\nThe only way to correct this kind of error is to go back through your code and figure out which part of the program is coded incorrectly.\n"
