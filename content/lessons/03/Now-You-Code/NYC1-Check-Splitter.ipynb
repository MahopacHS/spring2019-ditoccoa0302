It first prompts you to input the total amount of your check, then the number of people dining. It should then output the amout each diner must contribute to the check.  For example:\n\n```\n*** Check Splitter ***\nHow much is the amount of the check? 100.00\nHow many people ? 6\nEach person owes: $16.67\n```\n\nNOTE: Use string formatters to display the output to two decimal places.\n"

What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60?\n\nAn error happens because the program won't be able to convert the strings to numbers.\n\n2. What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code?\n\nThis is a value error which I don't think can be handled in code.\n\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? \n\nThe program doesn't run because it can't convert a string into an integer.\n"
