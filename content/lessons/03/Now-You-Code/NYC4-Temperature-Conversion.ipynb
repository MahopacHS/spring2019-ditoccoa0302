Is this an error?\n\nThe program still runs because the program accepts negative numbers too and the formula works for them as well. This is not an error.\n\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain.\n\nIt would not be difficult because all you have to do is switch the variables and change the formula.\n\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why?\n\nI did. This makes it easier to understand because it separates the math used to generate the variable from the printing of that variable."
