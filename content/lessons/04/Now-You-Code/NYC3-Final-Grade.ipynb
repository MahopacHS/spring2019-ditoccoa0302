How many times must you execute this program and check the output before you canbe reasonably assured your code is correct? Explain.\n\n12 times: once for each grade range, one value above 600, one value below 0, and one non-integer input.\n\n3. When testing this program do you think its more important to test numbers in the middle of the grade range or exactly on the boundary between one grade range and the next. Justify your response.\n\nOn the boundary between one grade range and the next because it verifies that the >= operators work as intended. For example, \"points > 570\" would accept values 571 and up, while \"points >= 570\" would accept values 570 and up like the grade range specifies."
