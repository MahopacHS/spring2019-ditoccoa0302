The program should output\nthe tally of heads and tails across the number of flips.\n\nFor Example:\nAfter 100000 flips. Heads: 50030, Tails 49970\n\nOf course, since the flips are random, the counts will vary each time the program executes.\n\nYour strategy should be to use a loop to flip a coin 100,000 times.\nAfter you flip you should check for heads or tails and increment the count\naccordingly.\n\n### How do you make Python simulate a coin flip?"

What is a definite or indefinite loop?\n\nI used a definite loop because it always stops after 100,000 iterations.\n\n2. Modify this program to allow you to input the number of times you would like to flip the coin. NOTE: if you enter a large number, the program could take a few minutes to execute. Be Patient!!!\n3. Explain how could this progam could be modified to track flipping a \"three\" sided coin with `heads`, `tails` and `foos` for example? Do not modify the code, only explain your strategy.\n\nI would modify the line that defines the coin variable to have three choices instead. Then I would add an additional 2 lines of code starting with elif to differentiate tails and foos. And lastly I would add some extra text to the sentence in the last line and insert another variable into it."
