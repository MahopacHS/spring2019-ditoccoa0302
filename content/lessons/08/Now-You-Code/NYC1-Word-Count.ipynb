Make your own file, add words to it then run with the word count program.\n\nThese files are located in the Now-You-Code folder.\n\n2. Explain a strategy for mkaing this program  smarter so that it does not include puncutuation in the word counts?\n\nWe can make this program do that by using line.replace to get rid of all punctuation marks before splitting the string into individual words.\n\n3. Is it possible to have a file with a word count of 0? Explain.\n\nYes, it's possible. If a file is blank, the program won't find any lines to read and won't increase the number of total lines."
