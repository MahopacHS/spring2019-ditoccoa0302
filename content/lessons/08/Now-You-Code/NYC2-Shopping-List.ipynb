Why or why not?\n\nI think the refactored code in step 4 isn't easier to read because it has an extra step. Instead of printing the items directly as it reads the file, the function puts these items on a list, which is then sent to the main program which prints each item in the list.\n\n2. Explain how this program could be refarctored further (there's one thing that's obvious).\n\nIt can be refactored further by taking the process of writing to the shopping list and turning it into a function.\n\n3. Describe how this program can be modified to support multiple shopping lists?\n\nThe program can support multiple shopping lists if it lets the user choose which file to access instead of only accessing one file. This can be done by setting the filename variable to whatever the user inputs instead of a specific file. We would also have to use try and except to handle FileNotFoundErrors."
