This has a variety of applications the most common being buiding an email list.\nThe best way to find the emails in the mailbox file is to search for lines in the file that begin with \"From: (similar to what we did in the lab). When you find an email write just the email address (not \"From:\" and the address) to \"NYC4-emails.txt\", and don't worry about duplicates.\n\nThe program should print the number of emails it wrote to the file.\n\nExample Run:\n\n```\nWrote 27 emails to NYC4-emails.txt\n```"

It just finds email addresses by reading the text that comes after \"From:\".\n\n2. Explain how this program can be improved to prompt for an email file at to process runtime?\n\nInstead of setting the filename to NYC4-mbox-short.txt, I would use an input statement to allow the user to enter the filename.\n\n3. Devise an approach to remove duplicate emails from the output file. You don't have to write as code, just explain it.\n\nInstead of appending the email address to the list for every line, I would use a conditional statement. I would only add on to the list of emails if the email it reads doesn't match any of the other emails in the list."
