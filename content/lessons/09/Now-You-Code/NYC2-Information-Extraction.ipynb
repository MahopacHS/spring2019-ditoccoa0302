      "source": "# Now You Code 2: Information Extraction\n\nHow do we make computers seem intelligent? One approach is to use *term extraction*. Term extration is a type of information extration where we attempt to find relevant terms in text. The relevant terms come from a *corpus*, or set of plausible terms we want to extract.\n\nFor example, suppose we have the text:\n\n`One day I would like to visit Syracuse`\n\nWe has smart humans can be fairly confident that `Syracuse` is a place, more specifically a `city`. \n\nA rudimentary method to make the computer interpret `Syracuse` as a place is to provide a corpus of cities and have the computer look up `Syracuse` in that corpus. \n\nIn this code exercise we will do just that. Let's first write a function to read cities from the file `NYC2-cities.txt` into a corpus of cities, which will be represented in Python as a list.\n\nThen write a main program loop to input some text, split the text into a list of words and if any of the words match a city in the corpus list we will output the word is a city.\n\nThe program should handle upper / lower case matching. A good approach is to title case the input. \n\nIMPORTANT: Please note that our program will ONLY work for one word cities, like `Syracuse` and will not work for multiple-word cities like `San Diego`. Don't worry about that now. \n\nSAMPLE RUN\n\n```\nEnter some text (or ENTER to quit): one day I would like to visit syraucse and rochester\nSyracuse is a city\nRochester is a city\nEnter some text (or ENTER to quit): austin is in texas\nAustin is a city\nEnter some text (or ENTER to quit): \nQuitting...\n```\n\nOnce again we will solve this problem using the problem simplification approach. First we will write the `load_city_corpus` function to build our city list. Second we will write the  `is_a_city` function which given a word and a city list will return `True` when the word is a city. Finally we conclude with the main program which finds cities in our text, as demonstrated in our sample run."
