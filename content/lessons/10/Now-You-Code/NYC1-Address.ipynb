Explain a strategy for a situation when an expected dictionary key, like 'state' for example does not exist?\n\nIf a key may not exist, we can use the try and except statements that will print that the key does not exist instead of giving back an error.\n\n2. The program as it is written is not very useful. How can we make it more useful?\n\nWe can make the program more useful if we allowed the user to enter multiple addresses which would be stored in multiple dictionaries in a list."
