What are the advantages to storing the number of days above freezing and below freezing in a Python dictionary?\n\nThe number of days below freezing and the number of days above freezing have their own labels and they could both be stored in the same variable.\n\n2. What is the data type of the weather data as it is read from the file `NYC4-syr-weather-dec-2015.json` ?\n\nWhen it is read from the file it is a string.\n\n3. Could this same program work for weather at other times in other cities? What conditions would need to be met for this to happen?\n\nThis program could work for weather at other times in other cities as long as there is a list of python dictionaries readily available that contains that weather."
